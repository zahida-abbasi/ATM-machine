Clone the Repository: Grab a copy of the project from the repository link. Install Dependencies: Make sure to install any necessary dependencies using npm or yarn. Run the Application: Launch the ATM simulator and follow the prompts to explore its functionalities. Feedback Welcome: I'm eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions on how to improve this ATM simulator. Your feedback is invaluable in refining and enhancing this project for the benefit of all users.

I hope you find this ATM simulator both enjoyable and informative. Best regards.
